  "description": "The project is a revolutionary idea which could change your vision of the investment and trade.  Nowadays, trade is generally unfair and we want to improve it. That is why ZDX was created. Socialist capitalists torture the poor and middle class of people in the economy based on credit. It describes as a transaction between a lender and a borrower, in which the borrower promises to pay back the money in the future along with interest.   So this idea of ​​interest was developed for ZDX to share our income with all investors. It's just simple, you invest and receive interest from ZDX revenue.  The ZDX coin represents the Zer-Dex asset exchange. The team has self-financing so we can share an interest in our most loyal investors. The purpose of ZDX is to share revenue from the Zer-Dex exchange earnings and divide it into the number of masternodes running on the network. Each masternode receives 50% of the revenue from our exchange and pays BIR asset. Your earnings will depend on the volume and the conditions presented in the communication channel.  Our goal is to increase the capital market in cryptocurrency to expand and have self-financing. The POS mining system, you can stake or create a masternode, 50% revenue from business income will be subdivided into each masternode running and this is additional prize to the masternode owner. They will be encouraged to stay in order to secure our network. We would like to encourage our investors to stay with us so the best way is to maintain a certain profitability with a return on investment.",
